# docker-compose example for Fat controller daemons stack: tcp -> tcp
#
# This daemon listens on a backend network socket.
#
# Fat controller creates a frontend network socket for it and proxies to the backend
# network socket
#
# redis is added, to show how the daemon can network with other containers in its
# own stack

version: "2.4"
services:

  # ??? the name of this daemon must be unique to the fat-controller network
