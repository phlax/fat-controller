# docker-compose example for fatc daemons stack: tcp -> tcp
#
# This daemon listens on a backend network socket.
#
# fatc creates a frontend network socket for it and proxies to the backend
# network socket
#
# redis is added, to show how the daemon can network with other containers in its
# own stack
